**Dialogue Graph** is an open-source editor tool for the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine used to create branching conversation trees in an easy and straightforward way by connecting nodes, and setting up conditions and triggers for the different conversation branches. An obvious use case for this tool is to create conversations with NPCs, although the versatility of this tool allows for any kind of project that requires branching behaviour based on checks and triggers.

## Compatibility

Dialogue Graph is compatible with the following Unity versions:

- 2021.3 LTS
- 2022.3 LTS

Other versions of Unity may work as well, but are not tested.

# Installing Dialogue Graph

## 1. using OpenUPM

**Requires [<img src="Github~/resources/openupm-icon-64.png" height="24px" align="center"/> OpenUPM-CLI][openupm-cli]**

Run the following on the command line in your unity project's folder:

```sh
openupm add dev.vecerdi.dialogue-graph
```

## 2. using Git

To install Dialogue Graph in your project use the Unity Package Manager.

To open the Unity Package Manager, inside unity, go to `Window > Package Manager` and to install Dialogue Graph click the `+` icon in the upper left corner of the window, then click on `Add package from git URL...` and paste in `https://github.com/TeodorVecerdi/DialogueGraph.git`

# Using Dialogue Graph (WIP)

## Editor

To start using Dialogue Graph, create a Dialogue Graph in your assets folder by going to `Assets > Create > Dialogue Graph > Empty Dialogue Graph`.

Dialogue Graph currently contains four different types of nodes: **NPC**, **Self**, **Property**, and **Boolean**.

### NPC and Self Nodes

#### General

TODO

#### Dialogue Lines

The NPC and Self nodes represent the dialogue lines said by either an NPC or the player. After creating one of these two nodes you can add dialogue lines by clicking the `Create Dialogue Line` button on each respective node.

Each dialogue line entry comes with additional ports. **Branch** and **Trigger** ports are available to both node types and the **Check** port is available only to NPC nodes.

The **Branch** port connects to the next node in the conversation tree. This connection is used by the runtime engine to progress the conversation once an option (dialogue line) was chosen. Unless you want the conversation to end with that line you should connect the Branch port to another node.

The **Trigger** port connects to one or more Trigger property nodes and is optional (more on that in the [**Property Nodes** section](#property-nodes)).

The **Check** port connects to one or more Check property or Boolean nodes and is optional (more on that in the [**Property Nodes** section](#property-nodes)).

#### Actor Port

NPC nodes also contain an **Actor** port to which you should connect your Actor Property node (more on that in the [**Property Nodes** section](#property-nodes)). Actor property nodes not only let you differentiate between which character performs the dialogue lines but also allows you to attach any custom data to the actor through scriptable objects.

### Property Nodes

TODO

### Boolean Nodes

DialogueGraph contains several nodes that can be used to combine multiple **Check** nodes into one:

- **NOT Node**: Negates the result of the **Check** port.
- **AND Node**: Returns true if both **Check** ports are true.
- **OR Node**: Returns true if either **Check** port is true.
- **XOR Node**: Returns true if exactly one **Check** port is true.
- **NAND Node**: Returns true if both **Check** ports are false.
- **NOR Node**: Returns true if either **Check** port is false.
- **XNOR Node**: Returns true if exactly one **Check** port is false.

You can combine multiple boolean nodes together to create more complex conditions.

If a boolean node has a missing connection, then that connection is assumed to be false.

#### Attaching functions to properties

Attaching functions to properties is almost identical to the way you would do it with the Unity UI system (Buttons, TextFields, etc). Attach a script to the object field and then choose the method you want to use.
